/**
 * Credential selection contract between the request pipeline and the credential store.
 *
 * Go source: sdk/cliproxy/auth/conductor_execution.go (pickNextMixed, MarkResult), sdk/cliproxy/auth/types.go (Auth).
 * The production implementation (`control-plane-picker.ts`) is a thin adapter over the ControlPlane Durable Object
 * RPC (`pick`, `report`, `planRetry`): the DO is the single writer for cursors, cooldowns, quota state and session
 * affinity. `static-picker.ts` is a config-only stand-in used by tests.
 *
 * Contract:
 *  - `pick` chooses one credential able to serve `model` for one of `providers` (in preference order), honouring
 *    `excludedIds` (credentials already tried in this round), `retryRound` (credentials age out of later rounds),
 *    `pinnedId`, session affinity (`session` within `callerScope`), priorities/weights and cooldowns. It returns an
 *    immutable snapshot, the per-credential model route and a lease. It fails with an `ExecutionError` whose `code`
 *    is `provider_not_found`, `auth_not_found`, `auth_unavailable` or `model_cooldown` (429 with `Retry-After`).
 *  - `report` must be called exactly once per attempt with the lease so cooldown/quota bookkeeping and affinity stay
 *    consistent. It never fails (bookkeeping errors are logged by the implementation).
 *  - `planRetry` answers whether another retry round is worthwhile and how long to wait first.
 *  - Snapshots must be treated as read-only; secrets in `attributes`/`metadata` must never be logged.
